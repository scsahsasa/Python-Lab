#Find the Simple Interest on Rs. 200 for 5 years at 5% per year 

# Given values
p = 200  # Principal amount in Rs.
rate_of_interest = 5  # Rate of interest per year in %
t = 5  # Time in years

# Calculate Simple Interest
si = (p * rate_of_interest * t) / 100

# Display the result
print("The Simple Interest is:",si)
